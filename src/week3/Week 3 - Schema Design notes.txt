Week 3 - Schema Design

*** Match the data access pattern of the application

* Rich documents
* Pre join/embed data
* No mongo joins
* No constraints
* Atomic operations
* No declared schema

One to many / many to many
=====================
* Use separate collections if many is large
* Embed if many is few

Multikey indexes
=====================
* Indexing an array so mongo indexes the values of an array
* Allows you to query against the array index

Benefits of embedding
=====================
* Improved read performance
* One round trip to the db

Trees
=====================
* List ancestors in an array of the document

When to denormalize
======================
1:1 		Embed
1:many		Embed from the many to the one
many:many	Link (arrays of object ids)

Storing large files (Grid FS)
======================
* Breaks up a large file into chunks
** stores the chunks in a collection
** stores meta data about the chunks in anohter collection
